# 📚 Novel to Anki & Audiobook Generator

An automated, locally-hosted AI pipeline that transforms raw Chinese web novels into rich, multimedia flashcards and immersive EPUB audiobooks. 

Designed for language learners, this tool uses **Local LLMs (Qwen2.5-14B)** and state-of-the-art **Text-to-Speech (Qwen3-TTS)** to dissect novels line-by-line, extract vocabulary, generate translations, and synthesize ultra-realistic Chinese audio—all running 100% locally on your hardware.

## ✨ Features

* **🧠 Smart Dual-AI Pipeline:** Uses `Qwen2.5-14B` for high-quality translation and `Qwen3-TTS (1.7B)` for lifelike text-to-speech.
* **⚡ VRAM Safety Bridge:** Intelligently unloads the 10GB LLM from GPU memory before loading the 4GB TTS model, allowing massive pipelines to run on standard 12GB consumer GPUs (like the RTX 4080).
* **📖 Dynamic Glossary Extraction:** The AI acts as a lore-master, tracking characters and locations in a `glossary.json` to ensure translation consistency across hundreds of chapters.
* **🖥️ Multi-Threaded GUI:** A sleek CustomTkinter interface that prevents system freezing, with live verbose logging and a fail-safe "Terminate" hook.
* **🎵 Opus Audio Compression:** Squeezes thousands of audio files into OGG/OPUS format, saving up to 90% space with zero loss in vocal fidelity.
* **📦 Polished Exports:** * **Anki Decks (`.apkg`):** Front/Back cards with native Audio, Pinyin, Literal Translation, and Natural English.
  * **E-Books (`.epub`):** Beautifully styled chapters with embedded HTML5 `<audio>` tags for immersive reading.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The codebase is modularized for extensibility and fault tolerance:
* `gui.py`: Multi-threaded Tkinter orchestrator with live terminal redirection.
* `main.py`: The core pipeline (Chunking -> Translation -> VRAM Flush -> Audio Gen -> Compilation).
* `utils.py`: Text sanitization regex and JSON-parsing logic.
* `prompts.py`: Few-shot prompts for precise entity extraction.
* `exporters.py`: EPUB manifest generation and Anki packaging.

## 🚀 Quickstart

This project is built to be cross-platform using **Conda**. FFmpeg, CUDA drivers, and Tkinter are all handled automatically.

### 1. Install & Setup
Requires [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) or NixOS.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nixos-ai-novel-generator.git](https://github.com/your-username/nixos-ai-novel-generator.git)
cd nixos-ai-novel-generator

# Create the environment with all system dependencies (FFmpeg, CUDA, Tkinter)
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate qwen_anki_env

# Run the setup script to install Flash-Attention 2 and Qwen3-TTS
python setup.py

```

### 2. Prepare the AI Server

You must have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running in the background. Pull the required translation model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q5_K_M

```

### 3. Launch the App

```bash
python gui.py

```

## 📂 Folder Structure

Drop your novel into the `Novels/` directory. The structure should look like this:

```text
Novels/
└── Novel_Title/
    ├── metadata.json           # (Optional) Book Title, Author, Cover info
    ├── cover.jpg               # (Optional) High-res cover art
    └── 01_Raw_Text/
        ├── ch_0001.txt
        └── ch_0002.txt

```

### Outputs generated by the app:

* `02_Translated/`: Safe plain-text backups.
* `03_EPUB_Chapters/`: Modular `.xhtml` files.
* `media/ch_0001/`: The compressed `.opus` audio files.
* `glossary.json`: The running database of proper nouns.
* **Final Files:** `Novel_Title.epub` and `Novel_Title.apkg`.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights for Developers

* **Flash-Attention 2 Integration:** Audio synthesis is accelerated using Dao-AILab's Flash-Attention, achieving sub-second speech synthesis on modern NVIDIA hardware.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Context Filtering:** The LLM does not ingest the entire glossary for every query. Instead, Python pre-scans the text and injects a "micro-glossary" of only relevant entities into the prompt, saving tokens and improving speed.
* **NixOS Compatibility:** Ships with a `shell.nix` file featuring custom Python overrides to enable native Wayland/X11 Tkinter support.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project was heavily inspired by Dr. Taylor Jones's (Language Jones) fantastic video, ["The BEST way to learn a language QUICKLY with books"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVpu66njzdE), which outlines the neuroscience and efficacy behind using local text-to-speech tools and Anki sentence mining for language acquisition.
